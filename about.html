                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>My name's Lukas Jovaisa and I'm currently studying Mathematics at university, but my journey here hasn't been a straight line. I started with a foundation year in Chemical Engineering, moved to Electrical Engineering, and eventually realised that pure maths is what I've always been passionate about. It just took a few detours to realise it.</p>
                
                <p>I've been tutoring for over 4 years now, and honestly, it started really naturally: just helping out my friends, explaining things the way I understood them. Then they'd thank me, their faces would light up, and I realised… I might actually be good at this. And more than that, I enjoyed it.</p>
                
                <p>Over time, that grew into something serious. I've taught all kinds of students: disabled, neurodivergent, older, younger, and one thing's always stayed true: you have to adapt to how they learn. That's why I don't stick to just one style or method. I watch, I listen, and I figure out what clicks for them.</p>
                
                <p>My philosophy? Understanding over memorisation. Always. That idea came from something unexpected: my love for languages. I've always been into language learning, and one platform in particular, Language Transfer, completely changed how I saw teaching. They teach through logic and connection, not repetition, and it's all free. That model inspired me. I want to build something just like that, eventually. A tutoring platform that runs purely off donations so that no student has to pay. That's the dream.</p>
                
                <p>Right now, I'm tutoring all subjects, not just maths. I originally did A-levels in Maths, Biology, and Chemistry, but I've taught plenty of other subjects just by learning them myself. Because I'm curious. I think everyone should be. Knowledge is power: eat or be eaten.</p>
                
                <p>I've taught across every major exam board: AQA, Edexcel, OCR, you name it. And while the exam boards differ, the problems are the same: students are taught to pass, not to understand. That's why I go outside the spec when needed. We link things to real-life examples, we build connections, and then we go back to the exam, again and again, so they don't just know what the examiner wants, they actually understand why.</p>
                
                <p>A lot of my proudest moments don't come from test scores; they come from trust. Like when students message me directly to mark their papers, even outside of lessons, because they know I get it. Because they know I care.</p>
                
                <p>One of my students once messaged me this:</p>
                <p><em>&ldquo;Honestly you are the only tutor that actually teaches from understanding and actually engages with us wanting to help us.&rdquo;</em></p>
                
                <p>That message came after they got almost all 9s in their GCSEs. I won't lie: I nearly teared up. But that message meant more than the grades. It reminded me what this work is really about — helping students unlock ambition, confidence, and genuine curiosity.</p>
                
                <p>Because here's what I believe: it's our job as tutors to figure out what makes each student curious. What drives them. What they enjoy. That's where their power is, and once we know how they think and what they care about, we can connect the subject to them. That's when they start to care. That's when things click.</p>
                
                <p>That drive, that spark, is what makes us human. It's how we got this far. Without curiosity, we wouldn't be here at all.</p>
                
                <p>And it's not just about teaching; it's about empathy. You get what you give. When students feel seen, heard, and supported, they rise. That's why I teach. Not to just pass exams, but to help people believe in themselves, and to show them that they can understand the world around them in ways that actually make sense.</p>
                
                <p>I tutor while I study because this is what I believe in. I want every student, no matter where they come from, to feel what it's like to get it. To feel ownership of knowledge.</p>
                
                <p>And to say, with confidence:</p>
                <p><strong>&ldquo;Wait — I can actually do this.&rdquo;</strong></p>
